The Django Doctor Appointment System is a web-based application designed to help patients book appointments with doctors easily.
One of the key functionalities of this system is email verification and confirmation of appointments.
When a patient registers on the system, they will need to provide an email address. 
This email address will be used to verify their identity and ensure that they are not a bot.
The system will send an email to the email address provided, containing a unique verification link.
The patient will need to click on this link to verify their email address. Once their email address has been verified, 
they can proceed to book appointments with doctors on the system.

When a patient successfully books an appointment, the system will send a confirmation email to the email address provided during registration.
This email will contain all the details of the appointment, including the date, time, and location.
The email verification and confirmation functionalities of the Django Doctor Appointment System help to ensure the security and accuracy of the appointment booking process.
 By verifying the email address of each patient and sending confirmation emails, the system helps to prevent fraud and errors in the booking process.
